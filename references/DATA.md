## Dataset Information


**model_name**
: The name of the bike's model. It contains some additional information like model year,engine etc.


**model_year**
: The year in which the model was built.


**kms_driven**
: Total kilometers the bike has been driven.

**owner**
: The represents which type of owner the bike has like it is first owner which means the current owner had bought the this bike as new, second owner means the bike has been sold to this owner from first owner and so on.

**location**
:  The location of the seller.

**mileage**
: Average mileage the bike gives. Its is represented as kilometer per liter of petrol (kmpl).

**power**
: Power is in terms of Bhp. BHP is the rate at which the torque generated by the engine in a bike is delivered to the wheels. Such that faster the deliverability, higher is the speed of the motorcycle and vice versa. For a bike that consists of a lower BHP can pull higher loads and for a bike that contains a greater BHP can propel the bike at faster speeds.
Thus, BHP depends on several factors such as deliverability, weight and power generation of the bike. Itâ€™s the most common way of rating a bike and determining which ones might be faster

**price**
: This is the target variable of the dataset.
